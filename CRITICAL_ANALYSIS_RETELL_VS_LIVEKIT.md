# Critical Analysis: Retell vs LiveKit Implementation

## Executive Summary

The calls are failing because you're trying to dial to **Retell's SIP infrastructure** (`5t4n6j0wnrl.sip.livekit.cloud`) instead of your own LiveKit project's domain. This fundamental misunderstanding stems from conflating Retell's proprietary infrastructure with standard LiveKit SIP functionality.

## The Core Issue

### What You're Doing (Wrong)
```javascript
// Your implementation
const sipUri = `sip:${participant.sipCallId}@5t4n6j0wnrl.sip.livekit.cloud`;
```

You're:
1. Pre-registering participants in YOUR LiveKit project
2. Dialing to RETELL's domain (`5t4n6j0wnrl.sip.livekit.cloud`)
3. Getting 480 errors because Retell doesn't know about your participants

### What You Should Do (Correct)
```javascript
// Correct implementation
const sipUri = `sip:${participant.sipCallId}@vocieagentpipelinetest-1z3kctsj.sip.livekit.cloud`;
```

Use YOUR project's SIP domain, not Retell's!

## Understanding Retell's Architecture

### Retell is NOT Pure LiveKit
- Retell is a **separate product** that uses LiveKit as infrastructure
- `5t4n6j0wnrl.sip.livekit.cloud` is Retell's **proprietary domain**
- Retell has custom logic on top of LiveKit for their AI agents

### How Retell Method 1 Works
```javascript
// Retell's approach - standard SIP trunking
target = [{
    type: 'phone',
    number: '+4953118054630',
    trunk: 'Retell'  // Named trunk pointing to 5t4n6j0wnrl.sip.livekit.cloud
}]
```

This works because:
1. Jambonz dials a **phone number** (not a SIP call ID)
2. The trunk routes to Retell's infrastructure
3. Retell handles everything internally
4. No pre-registration needed

### How Retell Method 2 Works
```javascript
// Retell's API approach
const retell_call_id = await registerCall(logger, {...});
target = [{
    type: 'sip',
    sipUri: `sip:${retell_call_id}@5t4n6j0wnrl.sip.livekit.cloud`
}]
```

This works because:
1. `registerCall` registers with **Retell's API** (not LiveKit's)
2. Retell creates internal mappings
3. When dialing to their domain, they recognize the call

## Your LiveKit Implementation

### Why It's Failing
You copied Retell's pattern but mixed domains:

```javascript
// You're doing this:
// 1. Register with YOUR LiveKit
const participant = await sipClient.createSipParticipant(...);

// 2. But dial to RETELL's domain!
const sipUri = `sip:${participant.sipCallId}@5t4n6j0wnrl.sip.livekit.cloud`;
```

**Result**: Retell's infrastructure receives the call but has no idea what `SCL_xxx` means because it wasn't registered with them.

### The Correct Approach

#### Option 1: API Pre-Registration (Your Current Attempt)
Fix the domain in your outbound trunk:

```javascript
// setup-outbound-trunk.js
const trunk = await sipClient.createSipOutboundTrunk({
    name: 'api-outbound-trunk',
    address: 'vocieagentpipelinetest-1z3kctsj.sip.livekit.cloud', // YOUR domain
    // ... rest of config
});
```

#### Option 2: Traditional SIP Trunking
Alternatively, use traditional inbound trunks + dispatch rules (no API pre-registration):

```javascript
// Traditional approach - dial to phone number
target = [{
    type: 'phone',
    number: formattedTo,
    trunk: 'schmidtkom-trunk'  // Your PSTN trunk
}]
```

## The Fix

Run this command to fix your trunk:

```bash
node fix-sip-domain.js
```

This will:
1. Check if your trunk is using Retell's domain
2. Delete the incorrect trunk
3. Create a new trunk with YOUR domain

## Key Takeaways

1. **Retell â‰  LiveKit**: Retell is a separate product with its own infrastructure
2. **5t4n6j0wnrl.sip.livekit.cloud**: This is Retell's domain, not yours
3. **Your domain**: `vocieagentpipelinetest-1z3kctsj.sip.livekit.cloud`
4. **API pre-registration**: Only works when you dial to the same domain where you registered

## Verification Steps

After fixing:

1. Check your trunk:
```bash
lk sip outbound list
```

2. Verify the address shows YOUR domain:
```
vocieagentpipelinetest-1z3kctsj.sip.livekit.cloud
```

3. Test a call - it should now connect successfully!

## Alternative Solutions

If you specifically want Retell's features:
1. Use Retell's actual product (not just their domain)
2. Implement similar features in your LiveKit agent
3. Use traditional SIP trunking without API pre-registration
