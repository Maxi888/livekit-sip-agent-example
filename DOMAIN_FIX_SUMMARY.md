# ✅ Domain Fix Applied Successfully!

## What Was Fixed

Your outbound trunk was using **Retell's domain** (`5t4n6j0wnrl.sip.livekit.cloud`) instead of your own LiveKit domain. This has been corrected.

### Before (Wrong):
```
Address: 5t4n6j0wnrl.sip.livekit.cloud  ❌ (Retell's domain)
```

### After (Correct):
```
Address: vocieagentpipelinetest-1z3kctsj.sip.livekit.cloud  ✅ (YOUR domain)
```

## Why This Matters

When you pre-register a SIP participant using `createSipParticipant`:
1. The participant is created in YOUR LiveKit project
2. You must dial to YOUR project's SIP domain to reach it
3. Dialing to Retell's domain won't work - they don't know about your participants!

## Next Steps

### 1. Redeploy Your Middleware
The middleware code is already correct (it uses `trunk.address`), so just redeploy:

```bash
cd livekit-jambonz-middleware
git push heroku main
```

### 2. Test a Call
Make a test call - it should now work! The flow will be:
1. Jambonz calls `/livekit-api`
2. Middleware pre-registers participant in YOUR project
3. Returns SIP URI: `sip:SCL_xxx@vocieagentpipelinetest-1z3kctsj.sip.livekit.cloud`
4. Jambonz dials to YOUR domain
5. LiveKit finds the pre-registered participant ✅
6. Call connects successfully!

### 3. Monitor Success
Watch for these success indicators:
- No more 480 errors
- Agent receives job
- You hear audio!

## Understanding the Difference

### Retell's Architecture
- Retell is a **separate product** built on LiveKit
- They have their own SIP domain: `5t4n6j0wnrl.sip.livekit.cloud`
- Their domain only works with their API and agents

### Your LiveKit Setup
- You have your own LiveKit project
- Your SIP domain: `vocieagentpipelinetest-1z3kctsj.sip.livekit.cloud`
- You must use YOUR domain for YOUR participants

## Troubleshooting

If calls still fail:
1. Verify agent is running: `python agent.py dev`
2. Check agent name matches: `my-telephony-agent`
3. Ensure middleware is using `/livekit-api` endpoint
4. Check logs for any new errors

The fundamental issue has been resolved - you're now using the correct domain!
