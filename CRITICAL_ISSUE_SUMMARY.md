# Critical Issue Summary: Agent Not Receiving Jobs

## Current Status (as of 17:50 UTC)

### ✅ What's Working:
1. **Room Creation**: Middleware successfully creates rooms before SIP participants
2. **SIP Pre-registration**: `createSipParticipant` returns valid sipCallId
3. **Correct Domain**: Using `vocieagentpipelinetest-1z3kctsj.sip.livekit.cloud` (not Retell's)
4. **Agent Running**: Agent is connected and registered with LiveKit

### ❌ What's NOT Working:
1. **Agent receives NO jobs** - despite rooms being created
2. **SIP participant not joining rooms** - room stays empty
3. **No connection between SIP call and room**

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue appears to be that while we're creating rooms and pre-registering SIP participants, the actual SIP INVITE from Jambonz is not being matched to the pre-registered participant. This results in:

1. Room exists but is empty
2. SIP participant is pre-registered but never joins
3. Agent never gets a job because no participant joins the room

## Evidence from Logs:

### Middleware (17:50):
```
Room created successfully
sipUri: sip:SCL_qSGH7CZ8X5Cp@vocieagentpipelinetest-1z3kctsj.sip.livekit.cloud
```

### Agent (last activity 13:57):
```
registered worker
id: "AW_Wx8ZwbQDQE2W"
```
No jobs received since startup!

### Rooms Check:
- 5 rooms exist (created by middleware)
- All rooms appear to be empty (0 participants)

## Hypothesis:

The SIP INVITE from Jambonz is not being properly routed to the pre-registered participant. Possible reasons:

1. **SIP Headers Mismatch**: The INVITE might not have the correct headers to match the pre-registered participant
2. **SIP URI Format**: The format `sip:SCL_xxx@domain` might not be correct
3. **Missing Configuration**: LiveKit might need additional configuration to accept calls to pre-registered participants

## Next Steps to Investigate:

1. **Check SIP INVITE Details**: Capture what Jambonz is actually sending
2. **Verify SIP URI Format**: Ensure we're using the correct format for pre-registered participants
3. **Check LiveKit SIP Logs**: See if LiveKit is receiving and processing the INVITE
4. **Test Direct SIP Call**: Try calling the SIP URI directly to isolate the issue
